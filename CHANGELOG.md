## [2.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta1)

###Fixed
- Issue with interactive gesture

## [2.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta1)

The library was rewritten in Swift, as a subclass of `UINavigationController`. This version contains breaking changes. 
Moving from a category to a subclass cleaned up the code quite a bit, making it more maintainable and hopefully less fragile. 
It also fully supports translucent navbars now. 

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar/releases/tag/1.5.1)

#### Added  
- Support to Carthage

## [1.5](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar/releases/tag/1.5)
